# HP-15C

My favorite calculator (got me through college).  The HP-15C uses Reverse Polish Notation (RPN).
In RPN, if you want to add 5 + 3, you type: 5 ENTER 3 +.  There used to be a complete HP-15C
calculator in the App Store, but it stopped being supported, so I created this one for myself.  

Here's a link to the original [HP-15C Owner's Handbook](https://www.hp.com/ctg/Manual/c03030589.pdf).
It describes all the capabilities and how to use them.

As described in the handbook, this app includes the following capabilities:
- Basic math and trigonometric functions
- Logarithmic and hyperbolic functions
- Time and angle conversions
- Degree/radian conversions
- Polar and rectangular coordinate conversions
- Statistics functions
- Programming
- Calculating with complex numbers
- Calculating with matrices
- Finding the roots of an equation
- Numerical integration

The following capabilities are not implemented:
- Inversion of matrices greater than 4x4
- Matrix LU decomposition
- Matrices containing complex numbers
