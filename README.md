# HP-15C

My favorite calculator (got my through college).  The HP-15C uses Reverse Polish Notation (RPN).
In RPN, if you want to add 5 + 3, you type: 5 ENTER 3 +.

There used to be a complete HP-15C calculator in the App Store, but it stopped being supported,
so I created this one for myself.  It only includes the basics (no programming, matrix calculations,
or complex numbers).
